# HNG-Data-Analyst-Internship
This internship provided hands-on experience in data analysis through real-world projects 
## Stage 0 (Titanic Passenger list)
+ I used the Titanic dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data 
+ The data set was divided into three groups: (train CVS, test CSV, and gender submission CSV).
+ The train CSV file contains 891 records, the test CSV file contains 418 records without the survived column and the gender submission file includes the "survived" column of the test CSV file.
+ I used Power Query to clean the data (e.g. adjusting the decimal points), merge the gender submission table and the test table, and then append it with the train table.
+ I used Power BI for data visualization, it displayed the total number of passengers, average age of passengers, total sum, and average sum of fare.
+ It displayed the number of passengers who survived and did not survive, their age, sex, train ticket, and where they embarked.
