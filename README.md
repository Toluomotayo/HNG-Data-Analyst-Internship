# 📊 HNG Data Analyst Internship

This project showcases my hands-on experience during the **HNG Data Analyst Internship**, where I completed a series of real-world data analysis tasks. The internship strengthened my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization using tools like **Power BI** and **Python**.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

The internship was structured in multiple stages, each focused on different aspects of data analytics. It combined real datasets, business problems, and analytical tools to help me grow into a more confident and job-ready data analyst.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI** – for interactive dashboards and reports  
- **Power Query** – for data cleaning and preparation  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – for EDA and visual storytelling  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for running and documenting Python analysis

## 📌 Internship Highlights

### 🔹 Stage 0 – Titanic Passenger List (Power BI Project)

- **Dataset**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)  
- **Data Used**: `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `gender_submission.csv`  
- **Cleaning**: Adjusted decimal points, merged gender submission with test data, and appended with train data  
- **Visualizations Included**:  
  - Total passengers  
  - Average age and fare  
  - Survival distribution by age, sex, ticket class, and port of embarkation  
- **Insight**: Helped reveal survival patterns by demographic and travel class.

### 🔹 Stage 2 – Marketing Strategy Dataset (Python Project)

- **Goal**: Perform EDA to derive insights from marketing performance data  
- **Cleaning & Prep**: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Converted date fields.  
- **Statistical Measures**: Analyzed ROI, CTR, CPC, and Conversion Rates using mean, median, and standard deviation  
- **Visuals Created**:
  - **Bar Charts** – to compare ROI across campaigns  
  - **Boxplots** – to examine the distribution of conversion rates  
  - **Heatmaps** – for correlation and monthly trend analysis  
- **Key Insight**: Campaign performance was stable across channels with few outliers  
- **Recommendations**: Implement A/B testing, enhance geographic targeting, and dig deeper into channel performance
